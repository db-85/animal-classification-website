This website has been deployed as a <b>Docker</b> container on <b>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</b>. It has been built using the following tech stack (among others):
<br><br>
<b>Backend:</b> Python (Flask, tensorflow/keras), JavaScript
<br>
<b>Frontend:</b> HTML/CSS/JavaScript
<br>
<h2> Next steps </h2>
Below is a non-exhaustive list of potential additions to this project:
<ul>
    <li>UI/UX: Improve the overall website design for a better user experience.</li>
    <li>Compatibility: Test the compatibility of the website on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, IOS etc.).</li>
    <li>Prediction: In addition to the class, report the probabilities of he picture belonging to each class.</li>
    <li>ML model: Improve accuracy of the model.</li>
    <li><s>CI/CD pipeline: More automated testing, reporting and deployment of updates. For instance, allow the model to be periodically updated, fitted to new data and deployed on the website.</s></li>
    <li>Data collection: Collect feedback from the user and store it in an RDS (relational database system) to assess the needs for updates.</li>
    <li>Data augmentation: In addition to prediction, the user should also be allowed to add their pictures to the dataset, so they can be included in the training/validation datasets.</li>
    <li>Monitoring: Generate reports periodically. Include model accuracy for each class and user feedback (e.g. whether their picture has been correctly identified).</li>
    <li>Classes: Add more classes, and allow the model to be trained with these new classes once sufficiently many pictures are collected.</li>
</ul>
